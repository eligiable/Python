Python Scripts to Automate

### AWS Web Scrapping

> Python script for web scraping specific data from amazon.com.
> 
> Disclaimer: Always review Amazon's Terms of Service before scraping. Unauthorized scraping may violate their policies.
>
> **How It Works:**
>
> **Headers**: The User-Agent header mimics a browser request and avoids being blocked.
>
> **URL Construction**: The script constructs a URL for the search query.
>
> **Request**: It sends a GET request to the Amazon search results page.
>
> **Parsing**: The HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup.
>
> **Data Extraction**: The script extracts product titles and prices from the search results.
>
> **Output**: The extracted data is printed to the console.
>
> **Limitations**:
>
> **Dynamic Content**: Amazon uses JavaScript to load content dynamically. This script may not work for pages with heavy JavaScript usage.
>
> **Anti-Scraping Measures**: Amazon may block your IP if it detects scraping activity.
>
> **CAPTCHA**: You may encounter CAPTCHA challenges, which require manual intervention.
>
> **Advanced Options**:
>
> **Use Proxies**: Rotate IP addresses to avoid bans.
>
> **Selenium**: Use Selenium to handle JavaScript-rendered content.
>
> **API**: Consider using Amazon's official API (e.g., Amazon Product Advertising API) for reliable data access.
